Cancer Tumor Classification(Benign or Malignant) using Convolution Neural Networks
#Objective                                                                                
This project presents the classification of skin cancer tumor detection with CNNs. This project model classifies the class of skin tumor i.e. either benign or malignant. A dataset of 1000 images belonging to each class were given as training data for accurate prediction and generalization of new data.
In principle, classification methods can be differentiated according to three principles. Approaches that use a CNN already trained by means of another large dataset and then optimize its parameters to the classification of skin cancer tumor are the most common ones used and they display the best performance with the currently available limited datasets.

#Approach
1. Initially, collected a dataset with 1000 images belonging to each class of cancer tumor i.e. benign and malignant.
2. Created convolutional layers by applying kernel or feature maps
3. Applied Max pool for translational invariance
4. Flatten the inputs
5. Created a Fully connected neural network
6. Trained the model
7. Using the model to predict the output [Python tkinter GUI]
